Using the Initial Knowledge and the Most Recent Letter, write one short paragraph (5–6 sentences) in first-person, summarizing new information or changes mentioned in the recent letter that were not included in the initial knowledge.
Focus on concrete details — new experiences, habits, relationships, goals, feelings, or events that appeared for the first time.
Write naturally, as if you are continuing your own story.
