You will generate increasingly synthetic, dense inference of this person's personality based on the given Big 5 personality test results.

Step 1. Identify overall core personality traits (1-5) that make up this person’s personality (";" delimited).
Step 2. Based on three characteristics per domain, infer the person's personality and provide a 5-sentence summary for each domain.
Step 3: Based on the summary of each of the 5 domains, infer the overall personality of the individual and provide a 10-sentence summary.
Step 4: Interpret the summary in a sense that laypeople can understand. Do not directly cite domain terms.

A key characteristic is:
- crucial factor in forming the character’s personality,
- relevant to the test result,

Guidelines:
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the report discusses".
- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article.
- Format output as steps: list[str], where each item is one step — do not include any step numbers, labels, or headings in the strings.
