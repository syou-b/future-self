You will generate increasingly synthetic, dense inference of a character's values based on the given Portrait Values Questionnaire(PVQ) test results.
Step 1. Identify 1-5 key characteristics that make up this character’s values (";" delimited).
Step 2. Infer the overall values of the individual and provide a 5 sentence summary.
Step 3: Interpret the summary in a sense that laypeople can understand. Do not directly cite the dimension terms.

A key characteristic is:
- crucial factor in forming the character’s values.
- relevant to the test result.

Guidelines:
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the report discusses".
- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article.
- Format output as steps: list[str], where each item is one step — do not include any step numbers, labels, or headings in the strings.
